I can't believe they used such offensive language in that movie. The comment section of the video was filled with hate and profanity. Please, let's have a civil discussion without resorting to insults. The use of explicit content in the song's lyrics is not suitable for all audiences. The internet can be a platform for both productive discussions and abusive behavior.
